Business\\nUNDERWRITING FOR P&C AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\\nThe Company underwrites the risks it insures in order to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification. Risk modeling is used to manage, within specified limits, the aggregate exposure taken in each line of business and across the Company. For property and casualty business, aggregate exposure limits are set by geographic zone and peril. Products are priced according to the risk characteristics of the insured\u2019s exposures. Rates charged for Personal Insurance products are filed with the states in which we write business. Rates for most Business Insurance products are also filed with the states but the premium charged may be modified based on the insured\u2019s relative risk profile and workers\u2019 compensation policies may be subject to modification based on prior loss experience. The Company also writes coverage in the excess and surplus lines market, primarily within global specialty, which is characterized by the absence of regulation related to rate and form and allows for more pricing and coverage flexibility to write certain classes of business. Pricing for Employee Benefits products, including long-term disability and life insurance, is also based on an underwriting of the risks and a projection of estimated losses, including consideration of investment income.\\nPricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future loss cost frequency and severity based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, the Company\u2019s response to rate actions taken by competitors, its expense levels and expectations about regulatory and legal developments. The Company seeks to price its insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will cover underwriting expenses and the ultimate cost of paying claims reported on the policies and provide for a profit margin. For many of its insurance products, the Company is required to obtain approval for its premium rates from state insurance departments and the Lloyd\\'s Syndicate\\'s ability to write business is subject to Lloyd\\'s approval for its premium capacity each year.\\nGeographic Distribution of Earned Premium\\n(% of total)\\nLocation\\nBusiness Insurance\\nPersonal Insurance\\nEmployee Benefits\\nTotal\\nCalifornia\\n8\\n%\\n2\\n%\\n2\\n%\\n12\\n%\\nNew York\\n6\\n%\\n1\\n%\\n3\\n%\\n10\\n%\\nTexas\\n5\\n%\\n2\\n%\\n2\\n%\\n9\\n%\\nFlorida\\n3\\n%\\n1\\n%\\n2\\n%\\n6\\n%\\nAll other [1]\\n35\\n%\\n9\\n%\\n19\\n%\\n63\\n%\\nTotal\\n57\\n%\\n15\\n%\\n28\\n%\\n100\\n%\\n[1]\\nNo other single state or country accounted for 5% or more of the Company\\'s consolidated earned premium in 2024.\\nCLAIMS ADMINISTRATION FOR P&C AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\\nClaims administration includes functions associated with the receipt of initial loss notices, claims adjudication and estimates, legal representation for insureds where appropriate, establishment of case reserves, payment of losses and notification to reinsurers. These activities are performed by approximately 6,900 claim employees including, among others, claim adjusters, appraisers, attorneys, doctors, nurses, behavioral health specialists, investigators and data analytics professionals as well as training staff, management, and support staff. The Company contracts with a select number of approved regional, national and international suppliers to enhance claim capabilities and business resiliency.\\nThe Company\\'s claims teams manage losses across the U.S. and internationally, working from locations across the U.S. and in two of our international offices. The teams are organized to meet the specific claim service needs for our various product offerings. The claims organization is supported by data and analytics, technology, and strategy located across the U.S. and in two of our international offices.\\nAs a leading provider of workers\u2019 compensation and employee benefits coverages, the Company leverages data analytics to return employees to active, productive lives as soon and safely as possible. Clinical experts focus on opioid usage, vocational rehabilitation, behavioral health and medical case management which we believe provides the Company with a competitive advantage for managing medical costs.\\nThe Company maintains a dedicated catastrophe claims organization that is positioned to respond to large-scale catastrophic events across the country. For the most severe events, the team is supplemented with additional Company staff to respond to claimants promptly after an event.\\nThe Company\\'s claims organization has a nationwide staff of attorneys who represent insureds in key jurisdictions, including dedicated lawyers specializing in complex litigation.\\nClaim payments for benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses are the largest expenditure for the Company.\\nREINSURANCE\\nFor discussion of reinsurance, see Part\\xa0II, Item\\xa07, MD&A \u2014 Enterprise Risk Management and Note 8 - Reinsurance of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n16\\n|\\nTable of Contents\\nIndex to Business\\nPart I - Item 1. Business\\nINVESTMENT OPERATIONS\\nHartford Investment Management Company (\u201cHIMCO\u201d) is an SEC registered investment advisor and manages the Company\\'s investment operations. HIMCO provides customized investment strategies for The Hartford\\'s investment portfolio, as well as for The Hartford\\'s pension plan and institutional clients.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of HIMCO\u2019s total assets under management was approximately $112.0 billion and $108.5 billion, respectively, including $50.9 billion and $50.3 billion, respectively, that were held in HIMCO managed third party accounts and $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, that support the Company\\'s pension and other postretirement benefit plans.\\nThe Hartford\\'s Investment Portfolio of $59.2 billion as of December\\xa031, 2024\\nManagement of The Hartford\\'s Investment Portfolio\\nHIMCO manages the Company\\'s investment portfolios to maximize economic value, ensure sufficient funding of the Company\\'s liabilities, and achieve enterprise financial objectives while remaining within acceptable risk tolerances. Portfolio objectives and guidelines are developed based upon the asset/liability profile, including timing and amount of claim payment obligations, investment return opportunity, and risk characteristics. The Company attempts to minimize adverse impacts to the portfolio and the Company\u2019s results of operations from changes in economic conditions through asset diversification, asset allocation limits, asset/liability duration matching, and active portfolio management, which may include the use of derivatives. Risk tolerances considered include, but are not limited to, asset sector exposure limits, credit issuer allocation limits, portfolio quality constraints including maximum exposure to below investment grade holdings, and interest rate duration limits. For further discussion of HIMCO\u2019s portfolio management approach, see Part\\xa0II, Item 7, MD&A \u2014 Enterprise Risk Management.\\nENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT\\nThe Company has insurance, operational and financial risks. For discussion on how The Hartford manages these risks, see Part II, Item 7, MD&A - Enterprise Risk Management.\\nREGULATION\\nState and Foreign Insurance Laws\\nState insurance laws are intended to supervise and regulate insurers with the goal of protecting policyholders and ensuring the solvency of the insurers. As such, the insurance laws and regulations grant broad authority to state insurance departments (\u201cDepartments\u201d) to oversee and regulate the business of insurance. The Departments monitor the financial stability of an insurer by requiring insurers to maintain certain solvency standards and minimum capital and surplus requirements; invested asset requirements; state deposits of securities; guaranty fund premiums; restrictions on the size of risks which may be insured under a single policy; and adequate reserves and other necessary provisions for unearned premiums, unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and other liabilities, both reported and unreported. In addition, the Departments perform periodic market and financial examinations of insurers and require insurers to file annual and other reports on the financial condition of the companies. Policyholder protection is also regulated by the Departments through licensing of insurers, sales employees, agents and brokers and others; approval of premium rates and policy forms; and claims administration requirements.\\nMany states also have laws regulating insurance holding company systems. These laws require insurance companies, which are formed and chartered in the state (\u201cDomestic Insurers\u201d), to register with the state department of insurance (referred to as their \u201cdomestic state or regulator\u201d) and file information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. Insurance holding company regulations principally relate to (i) state insurance approval of the acquisition of Domestic Insurers, (ii) prior review or approval of certain transactions between the Domestic Insurer and its affiliates, and (iii) regulation of dividends made by the Domestic Insurer. All transactions within a holding company system affecting Domestic Insurers must be determined to be fair and equitable.\\nThe extent of financial services regulation on business outside the United States varies significantly among the countries in which The Hartford operates. Foreign financial services providers in certain countries are faced with greater restrictions than domestic competitors domiciled in that particular jurisdiction. Our International operations include a Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate which is required to meet the minimum market standards set by Lloyd\u2019s, as well as UK PRA and UK FCA regulatory requirements. Consistent with the U.K.\\'s current interpretation of Solvency II, both Lloyd\u2019s and the PRA focus on the adequacy of capital held and solvency of an insurer against the risk profile and management of the authorized insurer in setting capital requirements.\\n17\\n|\\nTable of Contents\\nIndex to Business\\nPart I - Item 1. Business\\nFederal and State Securities and Financial Regulation Laws\\nThe Company sells and distributes its mutual funds and ETFs through a broker dealer subsidiary, and is subject to regulation promulgated and enforced by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the SEC and/or, in some instances, state securities administrators. Other subsidiaries operate as investment advisers registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers\u2019 Act of 1940, as amended, and are registered as investment advisers under certain state laws, as applicable. Because federal and state laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in securities markets, they generally grant regulators broad rulemaking and enforcement authority. Some of these regulations include, among other things, regulations impacting sales methods, trading practices, suitability of investments, use and safekeeping of customers\u2019 funds, corporate governance, capital, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.\\nFailure to comply with federal and state laws and regulations may result in fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension, termination or limitation of the activities of our operations and/or our employees.\\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\\nWe rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property.\\nWe have a trademark portfolio that we consider important in the marketing of our products and services, including, among others, the trademarks of The Hartford name, the Stag Logo and the combination of these two trademarks. The duration of trademark registrations may be renewed indefinitely subject to country-specific use and registration requirements. We regard our trademarks as highly valuable assets in marketing our products and services and vigorously seek to protect them against infringement. In addition, we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to on-line quoting, insurance related processing, insurance telematics, proprietary interface platforms, and other matters. Patents are of varying duration depending on filing date, and will typically expire at the end of their natural term.\\nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES\\nThe Hartford has approximately 19,100 employees as of December\\xa031, 2024.\\nManagement, including the CEO and Chief Human Resources Officer (\"CHRO\"), establishes the hiring and compensation practices for our Company. The Board is periodically updated on key employee engagement measures (including employee survey results). The Board\\'s Audit Committee receives an annual review of the Company\\'s key employee relations measures. In addition, the Board\u2019s Compensation and Management Development Committee (\u201cCompensation Committee\u201d) is responsible for reviewing performance and\\napproving compensation paid to senior executives, and, among other things, the oversight of succession and continuity planning for senior executive roles, setting the Company\\'s executive compensation policy and administering the Company\\'s Clawback Policy for senior executives. Our Human Resources team, led by our CHRO, supports the Compensation Committee in the execution of its responsibilities. In addition to the day-to-day support and counseling they provide to our leaders, managers and employees, the Human Resources team also monitors key indicators to keep a pulse on trends across our employee population including strategic workforce planning, employee engagement, employee relations matters, career mobility, talent attraction, retention, and development.\\nTalent Attraction, Retention and Development\\nOur commitment to a robust talent pipeline starts at the top. The Board of Directors engages with the Compensation Committee annually to review senior executive level talent, consider key emerging executive talent and conduct succession planning. In addition, our leadership team conducts a comprehensive annual talent review process across our organization each year.\\nTo keep pace with the evolving needs of our customers and the expectations of employees and external candidates, we focus on a broad array of actions, including:\\n\u2022\\nProviding career growth and development opportunities aligned to our strategies through our strategic workforce plans, executive, professional and front-line recruitment, internal mobility and job progression, and retention strategies;\\n\u2022\\nOffering extensive learning and development opportunities to sustain the skills needed for the roles we have today and those we anticipate in the future; and\\n\u2022\\nHolding leaders accountable for their progress against human capital goals that include development, engagement, mobility, succession, and retention.\\nFor entry-level roles in the organization, we', visual_elements=[], key_contents=['underwriting', 'premium rates', 'claims administration', 'geographic distribution of earned premiums', 'investment portfolio', 'reinsurance', 'risk management', 'regulatory oversight', 'claims handling capabilities', 'investment operations'], page_range=None, subsections=None)"
